# Statistics and Probability 

Statistics and Probability in Information Technology focuses on using **data analysis**, **probability models**, and **hypothesis testing** to make **informed decisions** and **solve problems** related to technology and digital systems. 

This knowledge is crucial for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, network security, and system optimization. Understanding statistics and probability in the context of information technology empowers IT professionals to make data-driven decisions and develop efficient solutions in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
